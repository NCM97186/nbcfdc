## INTRODUCTION
This module strives to deliver some extensions to the Entity Reference field
from Drupal core.

Currently it just provides additional Field Formatters
for Entity Reference fields with multiple values,
that allow to limit entity reference items that will be displayed
in different ways (first, last, offset, etc.) , allow to sort
the referenced entities by fields/properties on the entities and
allow to display some entities in a different view mode.

## REQUIREMENTS
no special requirements

## INSTALLATION
Install the module as usual
 
## CONFIGURATION
Go to entities display settings and enable the formatter
